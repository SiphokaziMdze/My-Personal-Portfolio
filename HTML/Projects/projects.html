    <p>Hey there! Take a look at what I've been building lately.</p>

    <section class="embedded-systems">
        <h2>Embedded Systems</h2>
        <p>I did Embedded Systems 3 as a module in my final year, it was a very interesting module. We were coding on arduino using C++. And we had some pretty cool projects</p>

    <section class="web-development">
        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>This is honestly my first love, this is how I got into coding. I started with Web Development. I did a lot of online programs (which I never finished 😢), but I honestly love Web Development because it taught me a lot. From using <i class="fa fa-free-code-camp" aria-hidden="true"></i>freecodecamp</i> to other websites like SheCodes, I have learned a lot.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the projects I have done in Web Development:</p>
        <ul class="web-projects">

                <li><h3>Personal Portfolio Website (the one you are currently on)</h3></li>
            </section>
            <section class="weather-app">
                <li><p>The app allows users to search for a city and view the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather. It also displays an icon representing the current weather condition.</p>
            </section>
            <li>To-Do List App</li>
            <li>Blog Website</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="ai">
        <h2>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>This is a new area for me, I am currently learning about it and doing some projects. I am really enjoying it so far, I am learning a lot and I am excited to see where this journey takes me.</p>
        <p>My first experience with AI was last year, 2025, when I was doing my final year. I chose an AI based project as my final year project, I can't lie, I was very nervous. I had never done anything with AI but here I was choosing it for my final year. But it helped that my project was going to be web based and I already had experience working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the project I am working on: </p>
