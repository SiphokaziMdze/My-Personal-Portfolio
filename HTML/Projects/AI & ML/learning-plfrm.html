    <h4>Functionality:</h4>
    <p>The platform offers personalized learning paths, adaptive content delivery, and real-time feedback to enhance the learning experience. It uses AI algorithms to analyze user data and provide tailored recommendations for courses, resources, and study materials.</p>  
    <p>I chose to focus on two modules that I did in school, Operating Sytems 2 and Database Systems 3. The platform also has a number of fun and educational games that are based on the content, this makes learning less boring, and more interactive.</p>
