    </header>
    <h3>A Weather App that provides real-time weather forecasts</h3>
    <p>This was probably my first and most favourite project because it literally showed me a world I did not know existed. This project is from my SheCodes Web Development certification.</p>
    <p>It introduced me to things like APIs and hosting. The project offers real-time and accurate weather forecasts and it is hosted on Netify.</p>
