    <p>This was probably one of my favourite projects ever, it was our final project (exam), we had to first build it on Tinkercad and see how the simulation works then transfer it to a breadboard</p>
    <h4>Components:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Arduino Uno</li>
        <li>Potentiometer</li>
        <li>DC Motor</li>
        <li>4 Green LEDs to simulate the machine drum</li>
        <li>1 Blue LED to simulate the Valve</li>
        <li>1 Red LED to simulate the Pump</li>
        <li>IR Sensor</li>
        <li>Push Button</li>
        <li>Power Supply</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Functionality:</h4>
    <p>When the simulation starts, you are prompted to add power, note that the power level goes up to 3. Then the pushbutton is pressed, the process does not start if the push button is not pressed. Pressing the pushbutton will trigger the Potentiometer, we use the Potentiometer to fill or drain the water. After you turn the Potentiometer, the washing process starts.  </p>
