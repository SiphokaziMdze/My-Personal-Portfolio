    <p>Hey there! Take a look at what I've been building lately.</p>

    <section class="embedded-systems">
        <h2>Embedded Systems</h2>
        <p>I did Embedded Systems 3 as a module in my final year, it was a very interesting module. We were coding on arduino using C++. And we had some pretty cool projects</p>
        <ul class="embedded-projects">
            <section class="washing-machine">
                <li><h3>A Washing machine that is powered  by Solar energy</h3></li>
                <img src="C:\Users\Siphokazi.Mdze\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2026-02-06 112303.png" alt="Washing Machine Project">
                <p>This was probably one of my favourite projects ever, it was our final project (exam), we had to first build it on Tinkercad and see how the simulation works then transfer it to a breadboard</p>
                <h4>Components:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Arduino Uno</li>
                    <li>Potentiometer</li>
                    <li>DC Motor</li>
                    <li>4 Green LEDs to simulate the machine drum</li>
                    <li>1 Blue LED to simulate the Valve</li>
                    <li>1 Red LED to simulate the Pump</li>
                    <li>IR Sensor</li>
                    <li>Push Button</li>
                    <li>Power Supply</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Functionality:</h4>
                <p>When the simulation starts, you are prompted to add power, note that the power level goes up to 3. Then the pushbutton is pressed, the process does not start if the push button is not pressed. Pressing the pushbutton will trigger the Potentiometer, we use the Potentiometer to fill or drain the water. After you turn the Potentiometer, the washing process starts.  </p>

        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>This is honestly my first love, this is how I got into coding. I started with Web Development. I did a lot of online programs (which I never finished), but I honestly love Web Development because it taught me a lot. From using <i class="fa fa-free-code-camp" aria-hidden="true"></i>freecodecamp</i> to other websites like SheCodes, I have learned a lot.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the projects I have done in Web Development:</p>
        <ul class="web-projects">
            <section>
                <li><h3>Personal Portfolio Website (the one you are currently on)</h3></li>
            </section>
            <section class="weather-app">
                <li><h3>Weather App</h3></li>
                <p>This was probably my first and most favourite project because it literally showed me a world I did not know existed. This project is from my SheCodes Web Development certification.</p>
                <p>It introduced me to things like APIs and hosting. The project offers real-time and accurate weather forecasts and it is hosted on Netify.</p>

                <h4>Technologies used:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>OpenWeatherMap API</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Functionality:</h4>
                <p>The app allows users to search for a city and view the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather. It also displays an icon representing the current weather condition.</p>

        <h2>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>This is a new area for me, I am currently learning about it and doing some projects. I am really enjoying it so far, I am learning a lot and I am excited to see where this journey takes me.</p>
        <p>My first experience with AI was last year, 2025, when I was doing my final year. I chose an AI based project as my final year project, I can't lie, I was very nervous. I had never done anything with AI but here I was choosing it for my final year. But it helped that my project was going to be web based and I already had experience working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the project I am working on: </p>
        <ul class="ai-projects">

                <li><h3>AI-Powered Personalized Learning Platform</h3></li>
                <p>This was my final year project. I honestly could not finish it, I still need to do a lot of work on it and perfect it.</p>
